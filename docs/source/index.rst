HCI Developer Documentation
===========================

Welcome to the developer documentation for the HLA Curation Interface (HCI).
These docs are split into four parts: tutorials, how-to guides, explanations,
and reference guides. We also have conventions that the code should conform to.

:doc:`tutorials` are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series
of steps to accomplish something with the HCI. They are wholly
**learning-oriented**, and specifically, they are oriented towards learning how
rather than learning what.

:doc:`how-to-guides` take the reader through the steps required to solve a
problem they are facing with the HCI. They are recipes, directions to achieve a
specific end. They are wholly **goal-oriented**.

:doc:`explanations` discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and
provide useful background information.

:doc:`reference-guides` contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects
of the HCI's machinery. Reference material is **information-oriented**.
