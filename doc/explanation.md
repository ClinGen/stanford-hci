# Explanations

Explanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
They broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic. Explanations can
equally well be described as discussions; they are discursive in nature.
They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the
software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or
even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion
document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.

## How Docker is used in this project

Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring that it runs
consistently across different environments. The project uses an app image based
on `python:3.13.0-slim-bookworm` and is responsible for running the Django
application. It installs Python dependencies, collects static files, and runs
the application using `gunicorn`.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.
The `compose.yaml` file specifies the services required for the project:

1. **Postgres**: A PostgreSQL database service.
2. **Redis**: A Redis service for caching and message brokering.
3. **Web**: The main Django application service.
4. **Worker**: A Celery worker service for handling background tasks.

Each service is configured with build instructions, environment variables,
volumes, and other settings to ensure they work together seamlessly. Docker
Compose allows you to start, stop, and manage these services as a single unit,
simplifying the development and deployment process.

## Using PyCharm

PyCharm is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Python
developers. I use PyCharm to work on this project because it provides a suite
of tools for code analysis, debugging, and version control. I've checked in the
`.idea` directory to the repository, which contains project-specific settings.
If you're using PyCharm, you can open the project by selecting the root
directory and opening it as a PyCharm project.
