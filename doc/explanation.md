# Explanations

Explanation, or discussions, clarify and illuminate a particular topic.
They broaden the documentationâ€™s coverage of a topic. Explanations can
equally well be described as discussions; they are discursive in nature.
They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the
software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or
even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion
document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
