# 3. Use Divio documentation system

Date: 2024-10-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I (Liam) would like the HCI to be well-documented.

The [Divio documentation system](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)
is a software project documentation system. From their website:

> There is a secret that needs to be understood in order to write good
> software documentation: there isnâ€™t one thing called documentation,
> there are four.
> 
> They are: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and
> explanation. They represent four different purposes or functions, and
> require four different approaches to their creation. Understanding the
> implications of this will help improve most documentation - often
> immensely.

We use this documentation system in other repositories as well.

## Decision

We will use the Divio documentation system.

## Consequences

It will (hopefully) be easier to document the HCI.
