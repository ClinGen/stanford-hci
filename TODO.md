- [ ] Models have a human-readable ID.
    - Ideas:
        - `AL`: denotes allele
        - `HP`: denotes haplotype
        - `ALC`: denotes allele curation
        - `HPC`: denotes haplotype curation
        - `ALA`: denotes allele association
        - `HPA`: denotes haplotype association

- [ ] The basic workflow for the app is in place.
    - [x] The user can sign up.
